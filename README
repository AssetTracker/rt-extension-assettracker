INSTALLATION

Please make a backup of your RT installation and database!

$ RTHOME=/path/to/rt perl Makefile.PL
$ make
$ make install
$ make initdb

Add RTx::AssetTracker to your Plugins in etc/RT_SiteConfig.pm and restart your web server.

UPGRADE

This is the first release of AT for RT 3.8, so there a no upgrade instructions. If you
already have installed AT under an older RT installation see the instuctions below.

UPGRADING FROM an AT installed under RT 3.6.* or older

This is the first release of Asset Tracker for RT 3.8, so there a no upgrade instructions. If
you installed an older version of AT under RT < 3.8 the best strategy is to remove AT files from
your installation and install AT as above, but skipping the rt-setup-database commands. Any AT
customization will have to be ported to the new version AT, which uses the RT plugins system.
Also, most AT configuration option have been renamed, and they are all now in the RT namespace.
So, for example the configuration option $RTx::AssetTracker::DefaultSearchResultFormat is now
$RT::DefaultAssetSearchResultFormat.

TODO: Document converting asset saved searches.
