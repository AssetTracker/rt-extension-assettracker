PREREQUISITES

A working RT 3.4 installation.

WARNING

Only mysql and SQLite are tested by the author. Feel free to send me a
schema file for other databases supported by RT 3.4

Oracle schema provided by Joop van de Wege.
Postgres schema provided by Rolf Schaufelberger.

INSTALLATION

Please make a backup of your RT installation and database!

If you are proficient in the world of autoconf and want to help
make installation easier, please let me know.

$ tar -xzvf at.tgz
$ cd at
$ ./configure --with-rt-home=/opt/rt3 --with-rt-local=/opt/rt3 --with-rt-localhtml=/opt/rt3/share/html --with-db-admin=root
# or: ./configure --with-rt-home=/opt/rt3 --with-rt-local=/opt/rt3/local --with-rt-localhtml=/opt/rt3/local/html --with-db-admin=root
# but then overlays and callbacks will be difficult

$ cd /opt/rt3
# Now patch for your version of RT if you want asset history to record tickets properly
$ patch -p0 < at/etc/upgrade/RT-3.4.x.patch
$ cd -
$ make install

UPGRADE

Please make a backup of your RT installation and database!

$ tar -xzvf at.tgz
$ cd at
$ ./configure --with-rt-home=/opt/rt3 --with-rt-local=/opt/rt3 --with-rt-localhtml=/opt/rt3/share/html --with-db-admin=root
# or: ./configure --with-rt-home=/opt/rt3 --with-rt-local=/opt/rt3/local --with-rt-localhtml=/opt/rt3/local/html --with-db-admin=root
# but then overlays and callbacks will be difficult (see the wiki for installing in local and using overlays)

$ cd /opt/rt3
# Now patch for your version of RT if you want asset history to record tickets properly (among other things)
# If there is no patch for your exact RT version then patching should not be necessary.
$ patch -p0 < at/etc/upgrade/RT-3.4.x.patch
$ cd -
$ make upgrade

     You may also need to update RT's database.  To find out, type:

       ls etc/AssetTracker/upgrade

     For each item in that directory whose name is greater than
     your previously installed RT version, run:

       /opt/rt3/local/sbin/at-setup-database --action schema \
           --datadir etc/AssetTracker/upgrade/<version>
       /opt/rt3/local/sbin/at-setup-database --action acl \
           --datadir etc/AssetTracker/upgrade/<version>
       /opt/rt3/local/sbin/at-setup-database --action insert \
            --datadir etc/AssetTracker/upgrade/<version>



Now if you are upgrading from AT 1.0.x to 1.2.x and you have been using the Parent field,
you will need to run a script that converts the Parents to links. Skip this step if you
never used the Parent field. Not sure? Running this script won't hurt anything.

$ perl $RTLOCAL/etc/AssetTracker/upgrade/1.2.0/AT-1.0.x-to-1.2.0.pl

If you are upgrading to 1.2.3 there has been a schema change, so you have
to run the schema upgrade (above) and then run a script to populate the new field.

$ perl $RTLOCAL/etc/AssetTracker/upgrade/1.2.3/AT-1.2.0-to-1.2.3.pl

* Please ask if you have any questions about upgrading! *


WARNING!!!

If you upgrade RT you will need to re-apply the patches. Also you will
probably need to chmod 755 $RTHOME/$LOCAL/etc/AssetTracker
It's best not to upgrade RT until a version of Asset Tracker has been
released that has been tested against that version of RT.

NOTE

MISSING FEATURES

* There is no Scrips system for AT, yet.
