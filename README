INSTALLATION

Please make a backup of your RT installation and database!

$ RTHOME=/path/to/rt perl Makefile.PL
$ make
$ make install
$ make initdb

Add RTx::AssetTracker to your Plugins in etc/RT_SiteConfig.pm and restart your web server.

UPGRADE

If you have AT 1.2.4 installed under RT 3.8, do the following:

1. Make a backup of any AT customizations.

2. AT now uses the RT plugins system. Remove all AT files fom the RT directories.
   After the "make install" step above put any AT customizations in
   $RTHOME/local/plugins/RTx-AssetTracker, add 

3. Add to RT_SiteConfig: 
       Set(@Plugins,(qw(RTx::AssetTracker)));

4.  Type:

    ls etc/upgrade

    For each item in that directory whose name is greater than
    your previously installed AT version, you must run upgrade
    commands.

    Each step is described below and may have additional instructions.
    Read them before running upgrade commands.

    Commands you should run to upgrade DB using data
    from etc/upgrade/<version> directory: If the dir has any schema
    files then run:

            /opt/rt3/sbin/rt-setup-database --dba <dba> \
            --prompt-for-dba-password --action schema \
            --datadir etc/upgrade/<version>

    If the dir has a file named 'content' then run:

        /opt/rt3/sbin/rt-setup-database --dba <dba> \
            --prompt-for-dba-password --action insert \
            --datadir etc/upgrade/<version>

UPGRADING FROM an AT installed under RT 3.6.* or older

If you installed an older version of AT under RT < 3.8 the best strategy is to remove AT files from
your installation and install AT as above, but skipping the rt-setup-database commands. Any AT
customization will have to be ported to the new version AT, which uses the RT plugins system.
Also, most AT configuration option have been renamed, and they are all now in the RT namespace.
So, for example the configuration option $RTx::AssetTracker::DefaultSearchResultFormat is now
$RT::DefaultAssetSearchResultFormat.
